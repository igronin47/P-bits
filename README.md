 **P-bit Simulator:**
This framework is built using Python to simulate p-circuits for probabilistic computing. A p-bit fluctuates between 0 and 1, functioning based on the probability of outcomes.

**Installation:** Clone the repository and set up a version 3.10 or higher Python environment. I recommend using PyCharm, as it automatically installs the required libraries.

**Simulation:** h matrices, which are c.h, will be used for clamping the biases; here, many circuit biases are already given to 10 or -10, which is just used for testing; you can use smaller biases, i.e. 3 or -3. The main thing is to keep in mind that biases should be provided according to the required nodes, which are commented in every circuit's codes.

**Plot:** For plotting the graph, it is better to use other software like Origin Pro, excel, or Python Matplot tool; first, write < output > into a CSV file and then export it for plotting the graphs, or you can use histplot(output) for directly plotting the smaller circuits.
